      ###Instructor Notes

      ###Teens Learning Code: Learn to Build a One Page Website with HTML & CSS

      <br>
      ##Schedule

      <strong> Important note:</strong>
      This is a guideline, not a rule! It is more important that the learners are following along then it is to get to the end of the slides!

      <em>Please note</em>: this schedule is for a two-day workshop.
      If you are leading it on one day, you can merge the schedule up accordingly, doing the Day 2 stuff on the second day and ensuring to take two 15 minute breaks on both days.  you can split this schedule up accordingly.
      ## Day 1
      * <strong>Optional Lunch + Teens Survey (12:00 pm - 1:00 pm) </strong>
      * <strong>Introductions (1:00 pm - 1:30)</strong>: Ice breakers, overview
      * <strong>Exploring (1:30pm - 2:00 pm)</strong>: Learning about websites, project brainstorm
      * <strong>Intro to HTML (2:00 pm - 3:30 pm)</strong>: The Anatomy of a Webpage
      * <strong>Wrapping it up (3:30 pm - 4:00 pm)</strong>


      <br>
      ##General Notes

      * <strong>Important!</strong> Please give learners enough time to download learner files. Check in as people are entering the room to make sure they have learner files.
      * A common issue with leaner files - make sure Windows users extract the folder. If a learner sees the slides without any styles, that is probably why.

      Before the class starts, update the WiFi credentials on slide 1.

      <br>
      ##Specific Examples

      **Slide 4: Introductions**

      *Have all learners and mentors introduce themselves! Maybe ask them what their goals for the workshops are? Ask the mentors to share what type of work they do and how they could help.*

      Hey everyone, welcome to the Teens Learning Code Workshop!

      Raise you hands if it's your first workshop with Canada Learning Code.


      **Slide 6: ICEBREAKER ❄️**

      *Feel free to use one the the ice breakers linked [here](#)* <!--Update ice breakers link -->


      **Slide 11: WHAT EXACTLY IS A WEBSITE?**

      One page websites are trendy and utilitarian. If you are a person, a small business that offers a service, or just want to get an idea on the web, 1 page is sufficient to get your point across.

      **Slide 12: LET'S THINK 🤔**

      *Think, pair, share time. Have the learners break off into small groups of 2-4 to discuss the importance of websites and share their reflections to the larger group.*


      **Slide 15: WEB BROWSERS**

      Ever browser will render a web page SLIGHTLY differently. It's part of a developer's job to correct for this and make sure the experience is the same across all browsers. To make today's experience flow seamlessly, we're all going to use the same browser today.


      **Slide 16: DEVELOPER TOOLS**

      Using the Developer Tools can be really intimidating for beginners, especially this early on in the class. You can show it briefly and talk about how helpful it is for you, but don't dwell on this for too long. Underscore that these tools help make your workflow more efficient once you become more proficient with code. Some of the learners will really dive right in and get excited, but a majority will not be ready to use it today, and that's perfectly okay!

      **Slide 17: LET'S TAKE A LOOK 🔍**

      Walk the learners through an activity to use the developer tools to edit the profile image on the website linked. They can go to goole images and find their own link and replace it.

      **Slide 18: HOW DID IT GO?**

      Ask the learners to share how they went through the process. Note, this part of the workshop could be tricky for several people since we haven't gone through the syntax of HTML yet, and this was just a chance to explore the code.

      Walk the learners through an activity to use the developer tools to edit the profile image on the website linked. They can go to goole images and find their own link and replace it.


      **Slide 19: EXAMPLE TEEN PROJECT**

      This is an example project made by a group of teens at one of the HTML workshops. Show them the link to the website and illustrate how this group of teens used web-development to solve a problem they're passionate about.

      **Slide 20: PROJECT BRAINSTORMING TIME 💭**

      Tell the teens they can choose one of these How Might We Questions, or come up with their own. Make sure they focus on a specific problem that they want their website to solve, and they can feel free to work with groups or by themselves.

      If you've already conducted this workshop at the same location, feel free to swap out any How Might We questions with ones you come up with or some of the options below:

      *Questions*

      * How might we make it easier for students to explore different career paths?
      * How might we financially empower students?
      * How might we reduce our water usage?
      * How might we reduce our carbon footprint?
      * How might we minimize any stigma involving mental health?
      * How might we make it easier to plan travel?

      *Themes*

      * Education
      * Finance
      * Environment
      * Health

      Remember, try to use topics that would be most relatable to teens and don't require much research as well to develop the solution.

      **Slide 25: HTML SYNTAX**

      Take the time to point out these characters on the keyboard. They are not used often by average users, and take some time to form the muscle memory. Someone who can usually type blog posts or word documents without looking at the keyboard may have to look down more frequently today, and that is perfectly okay!


      **Slide 27: Nested Tags**

      Compare this to layering two sweaters - the order in which they close matters! You have to zip up your inner sweater before you can zip up the outer sweater - if you try to cross the zippers up, it won't work!


      **Slide 28: ORGANIZING YOUR CODE**

      Indentation is ESSENTIAL, especially for beginners, to better exercise the pattern recognition parts of their brains. It makes debugging your code 100x easier. REALLY emphasize and encourage good habits early on. When you're doing a code along, tell them out loud when it's important to indent, and when it is more of a personal preference (eg. text within an `<a>` tag)


      **Slide 36: THE HEAD ELEMENT**

      People can SEE your body, but they cannot see what is going on inside your head. What's going on inside your head is integral to making your body function, but you have to take a peak "under the hood" (viewsource) in order to see what elements are in the `head`.


      **Slide 38: ATTRIBUTES**

      In case you get asked, UTF-8 is the most popular character code. It covers European (latin based) languages, Greek, Kurdish, and Iranian languages. If you're website is in Mandarin, Cantonese or Japanese, you will need to use a different character code (UTF-8 only covers 86-88% of the characters in those languages).

      To explain attributes in general, you can show them a fake tag to represent your coffee order:

      ```
      <coffee order="latte" milk="almond" sweetener="honey">Laura</coffee>
      ```


      **Slide 41: HTML5 STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS**

      A class is like a piece of tape on a ziploc container in your fridge. It should describe the contents of the container.


      **Slide 55: ABSOLUTE PATHS**

      Scroll down to make sure everyone sees the last sentence on this slide - it can be really helpful to understand the difference. This is a very difficult concept for beginners to wrap their heads around, so don't rush while explaining this one.


      **Slide 60: HYPERLINKS**

      Avoid using words like "click here" in a link. Use something more descriptive, like "get in touch with us" or "read the annual report". This is good practice for accessibility and gives the user a clear idea of what a link will do without having to read all the surrounding text for context.

      **Slide 63: WHAT'S NEXT?**

      Congratulate them on what they all just learned! Get them excited for the second part of the workshop, where they'll be learning CSS. Encourage them to continue thinking about their websites and brainstorming before the next workshop.

      ## Day 2
      * <strong>Optional Lunch (12:00 pm - 1:00 pm) </strong>
      * <strong>Welcome back (1:00 pm - 1:30)</strong>: Team builder, refresh
      * <strong>Intro to CSS (1:30pm - 3:00 pm)</strong>:
      * <strong>Finishing up projects(3:00 pm - 3:30 pm)</strong>:
      * <strong>Wrapping it up + sharing (3:30 pm - 4:00 pm)</strong>


      **Slide 65: WELCOME BACK**

      Ask them if they brainstormed anything for their website and what they're looking forward to learning today!

      **Slide 66: TEAM BUILDER**

      Instead of an ice breaker, they'll be doing team builder activities.  Feel free to use one the the teambuilder activities linked [here](#)

      **Slide 67: CHECK FOR UNDERSTANDING**

      Go over key elements that were taught during the HTML workshop.

      **Slide 69: CSS: THE PRESENTATION LAYER**

      Same as we did with the HTML syntax slide - take the time to point out these characters on the keyboard. They are not used often by average users, and take some time to form the muscle memory. Someone who can usually type blog posts or word documents without looking at the keyboard may have to look down more frequently today, and that is perfectly okay!


      **Slide 70: CSS SYNTAX & TERMINOLOGY**

      You can use the coffee order analogy again to explain how properties are applied to a selector. The barista is looking for YOU, as the selector. Then they gather the properties that you want in your beverage order:

      ```
      laura{
         order: cold-brew;
         milk: soy;
         flavour: vanilla;
      }
      ```


      **Slide 71: MULTIPLE CSS DECLARATIONS**

      Remind learners that NONE of us have all the properties memorized. It's a good idea to bookmark some frequently used resources (found at the bottom of this slide), or walk them through how to do a Google search for a property, like 'change font size with CSS' or 'change colour of text with CSS'.


      **Slide 79: CSS FONT STYLES**

      Note out loud that `color` needs to spelled the American way. It's a common hiccup for beginners.


      **Slide 82: CLASS EXERCISE: HOW TO USE GOOGLE FONTS**

      Show them what happens when you select many fonts and the effect it has on the loading time. Think of each font as a rock you're adding to your backpack when going on a hike. The heavier the backpack, the slower you're going to be walking. A website works the same way! Keeping things lightweight and only including the resources you need makes the site perform faster.


      **Slide 83: INHERITANCE AND SPECIFICITY**

      Why is the `h1` more specific? Because it is a **child** of the body. Child elements are always more specific than their ancestors.


      **Slide 86: CLASS EXERCISE #5: TYPOGRAPHY (CONTINUED)**

      A good opportunity to bring up performance again. Images should always be cropped, resized and optimized for use on the web, otherwise large image files can really slow the website down.


      **Slide 97: THE BOX MODEL**

      Imagine you're packaging a fragile object for shipping. The `padding` is like the bubble wrap or packing peanuts that go inside the box to protect the object. The border is like the edge of the box. The margin is the distance between the box and whatever is around it.


      **Slide 99: MARGIN AND PADDING**

      Encourage people to use the long form for today if it is easier to understand. Alternatively use comments to remember which value represents which side.


      **Slide 105: CLASS EXERCISE #7 - SPACING**

      Take the time to see if a learner can answer this before you reveal the answer. No guess is a bad guess! Don't correct them immediately - type out what they say and see if someone else can make a correction. Only reveal the answer if they're really stuck.


      **Slide 109: DESCENDANT SELECTORS**

      It can help to either read this from right to left, or where you see a space, imagine saying "and then...". Each space looks one level deeper.
      A common mistake is to use the syntax or descendant selectors when you meant to combine selectors, or vice versa. Commas are used when you are listing items in a sentence: "I need to buy bread, apples, bananas etc."


      **Slide 113: BUILDING A WEB PAGE IN BLOCKS**

      Tips to organize yourself when building a website:<br>
      1. Draw out your plan on paper<br>
      2. Create a to-do list and be as granular as possible - computational thinking is all about taking a big problem and breaking it up into small, actionable steps<br>
      3. Do the broad brush strokes first and add in more detail as you go. Start with the content skeleton, then apply layout, then colours, and so on.<br>
      4. Take some breaks as you go - when you look at the same code for a long time you start to loose objectivity. Refactor your code after you've taken some time away from it - do you have unused styles you could delete? Could you have coded something in a more efficient way?


      **Slide 117: BLOCK VS INLINE**

      Tip - apply this to your CSS to show them these borders:

      `* {outline: 3px solid red;}` - you can adjust the border size depending on the size of the space and projector


      **Slide 122: CSS GIF**

      This is a very relatable GIF - whether you're a beginner or a seasoned dev. Take some time to have a laugh, then refer back to the broken layout to try and explain the concept clearly. Walk up to the projector and use your hands to describe what is going on.


      **Slide 125: BORDER-RADIUS**

      Just note the 50% border radius will only crop the image into a circle if the original image is square. Otherwise it'll be an oval shape.


      **Slide 136: BONUS-EXERCISE**

      If there's enough time in the workshop, show them how they can put their sites online. If there's not enough time, skip to the end but let the learners know they can go back and refer to this later.

      **Slide 142: Today...**

      Now is the time to acknowledge and congratulate the learners - they should feel proud for taking the time to learn something new, push themselves out of their comfort zone and challenge themselves. This workshop covered a lot, so feeling overwhelmed is totally expected and normal. Don't forget to acknowledge and thank the mentors at this time too!


      **Slide 146: NEXT STEPS!**

      Get them excited about where they can go from here, whether that be through more workshops with us, independent learning, or where they can find local meet-up groups or events, online or in person.

      Have learners share what their own next steps will be for their projects.
